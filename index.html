                        <h2>Bijay Thada Magar</h2>
                        <h3>Singer & Musician</h3>
                        <p>My name is Bijay Thada Magar, born on August 23, 2001, to parents Ram Bahadur and Indramaya Magar. Although I come from a non-musical family, I was drawn to music from an early age. My parents, both strict teachers, still supported my interest and gifted me a guitar on my 15th birthday—a turning point that ignited my musical journey. What began as a hobby soon evolved into a deep passion, especially after receiving positive feedback on cover songs I posted online.</p>

                        <p>I officially began my professional journey when I joined Symphony Band in 2019. That same year, I released my first successful single, "Tadha-Tadha" on Kripa Drishya Digital. In 2021, I participated in The Voice Nepal Season 3, where I was selected by Coach Raju Lama during the blind auditions and reached the Top 11. Performing emotionally powerful songs such as "Jaat" by Chewang Lama and other rock and semi-classical pieces, I gained recognition for my vocal range and stage presence.</p>

                        <p>My second song with the band, “A Call From Nature (Mitho Maya)”, received a lot of love from listeners, further solidifying our place in the Nepali music scene. Currently, I’m working on my first full-length album titled "BHAWANA", with three songs already recorded and more in progress.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Live Performances & Musical Experience</h2>
                <div class="experience-content">
                    <p>Live performances bring me joy and comfort—I love connecting with the audience through stage presence, body movement, and genuine interaction. Whether it’s shout-outs, banter, or just sharing a moment, I believe in creating an uplifting experience for the crowd. I’ve developed a unique ability to control the atmosphere and project emotion, forming a strong bond with listeners regardless of cultural backgrounds.</p>

                    <p>Before The Voice, in July 2019, my band and I appeared in the "I Can Sing" segment on YoHo HD TV, performing covers of popular songs like “Timi Nai Hau,” “Kasari,” and “The Messenger.” Since then, my schedule has been filled with concerts, gigs, and studio sessions. Some of these events have been incredibly memorable and transformative, giving me the platform to share my music on a broader scale.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I perform live six days a week—four days with my band Symphony and the rest as a solo artist at various venues around Kathmandu and beyond. My band and I also tour around 10 places each year, bringing our music to different cities and communities.</p>

                <div class="teaching-content">
                    <p>Alongside performing, I’ve been offering voice lessons from home for the past two and a half years, and I also conduct online vocal classes for school children. Teaching helps me stay grounded and gives me a chance to share the passion and techniques I’ve learned along the way.</p>
                    <p>My journey into music began at church choirs, and I was influenced early on by my uncles and brothers who performed at annual festivals. These experiences, along with my admiration for artists like Aerosmith, particularly songs like “Crazy” and “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” deeply shaped my musical taste and artistry.</p>
                    <p>After completing high school from Pushpalal Memorial College in Chabahil, Kathmandu, I decided to pursue music full-time—though I once considered a degree in Computer Science. I continued my music education at Nepal Music Center (guitar) and Sangeet Pathsala (keyboard), which refined my musical abilities and expanded my knowledge.</p>

As I continue creating, teaching, and performing, my goal remains the same: to inspire and connect with people through the power of music.</p>
